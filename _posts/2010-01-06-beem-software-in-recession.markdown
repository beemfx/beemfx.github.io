Due to the effects of the recession, Beem Software is temporarily closing it's doors. It was with great disappointment that we had to lay off most of our staff. We held out for as long as we could, but in order to avoid bankruptcy we are delaying all of our current projects. Beem Software is not completely dead, but it may be several years before it is back on it's feet.
We are still working with <a href="http://www.roughconcept.com">Jack Everett</a> in developing the script and design for our most recent project, but other than story and design, this game will not be in full development until we can obtain funding.

Beem Software will continue to work on private contracts, unrelated to game development.
