<pre>Quite a bit more work on the game, some code revisions, and
further development of the NET code. But the biggest thing is that the
server now runs on a separate thread, so the game can take advantage of
multi-core CPUs. Indeed, the performance boost was amazing. Also, of note,
the Legacy map format has almost been eliminated from Emergence, the emap
format has been established, and the plugin for 3D World Studio written, but
it has not been implemented yet.</pre>
