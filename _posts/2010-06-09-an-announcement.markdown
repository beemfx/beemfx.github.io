Earlier this year we indicated that Beem Software's studios were shut down due to the effects of the recession. Unfortunately this announcement isn't to state that we our reopening our studios, but we do want to say that we our still working on developing new technology. We don't anticipate full blown development of any video game titles any time soon, but the foundations are being laid. This post is more or less to say that we still exist. We just aren't doing much right now.
