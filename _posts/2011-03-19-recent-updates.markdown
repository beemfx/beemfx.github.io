<pre>Quite a bit of new progress has been made. The portal rasterization system is
complete, and for the most part seems to be working. Major improvements to the
audio system have been completed as well. General improvements to the code have
been made, and the server and client now communicate better, plus clients can
be disconnected and connect in a more efficient manner. The skybox is now part of
the save state, so it can now be customized. Other improvements of "hard coded"
items have been fixed as well.
There is still a lot of work to be done, but progress is coming along. I may be
done with the client side for a while, as I need to get into AI control, and
things like joints for doors.</pre>
