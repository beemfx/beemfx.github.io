<pre>Development of the Emergence Game Engine begins. This occurred
shortly after the Legacy Game Engine was scrapped. The decision to scrap the
Legacy Engine was not an easy one, and certainly not the first idea to come to
mind, but the Legacy code and engine was not well designed, and there was
little hope in simply rewriting portions of the code.
The Legacy Engine was simply trying to be too much, and in the process became
an inconsistent pile of code. Though some of the techniques and even some of
the classes used in the Legacy Engine were ported to the new Emergence engine,
for the most part Legacy will be a thing of the past.</pre>
