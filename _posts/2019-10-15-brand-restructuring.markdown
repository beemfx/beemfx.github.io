<p>To reduce the number of domain names we were managing we dropped the beem.media domain name in favor of beemsoft.com. While this domain doesn't necessarily represent our perspective as an entertainment company it does put us in the .com sector and cost significantly less to maintain than .media. We've also dropped the RoughConcept.com brand altogether in favor of JackEverett.com.</p>

<p>We've also furthur separated out your branding on YouTube to separate channels that meet the expectations of their audiences.</p>
