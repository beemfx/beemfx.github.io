Though Beem Software has been in operation since 1997 and has even had various websites over the past 10 years, it wasn't until December of last year that Beem Software obtained their very own domain beemsoft.com, and it wasn't until February 9, 2007 that Beem Software began serious pursuits of their online content. Though it will be several months before the Beem Software website has the all the information about Beem's products that the board wants it to have they are still pleased to have the site up and running.
