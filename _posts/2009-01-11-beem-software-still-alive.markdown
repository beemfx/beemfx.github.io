Yes, Beem Software is still developing software, even though it has been some time since our website was updated.  We have very little to report on, however since our publisher is managing our project.  A Lantern in the Dark was officially cancelled, but another project based on the Legacy of Heaven &amp; Hell mythos is in development.  We are also working on a puzzle game called Sometimes Y.  Chances are within six months we'll have a fully blown demo of the Legacy game.
