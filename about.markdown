### Beem Media

Beem Media was originally founded by Blaine Myers in 1997 under the name  B.M. Software. We changed our name in to Beem Media in 2015 to  represent our global mission to develop all forms of entertainment,  including written media, video production, and video game development.

Beem Media owns and manages several YouTube channels as well as producing video games. We have also published the written works of [Jack Everett](https://jackeverettblog4.wordpress.com/).
